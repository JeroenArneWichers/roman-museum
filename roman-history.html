                <p>There are many sources that describe the foundational history of Rome. Some more accurate than others. The most well known perhaps are Tacitcus, Livius and Virgil. But also modern scholars, like P. Nilsson, have provided us with the neccesary sources.</p>
                <p>We shall give a brief account of the most well known and memeorable myths and legends that surround the foundation of the great Roman civilization.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">The epic of Aeneid</h2>
                    <p>The national epic of mythical Rome, the Aeneid of Virgil, tells the story of how Trojan prince Aeneas came to Italy. According to the Aeneid, the survivors from the fallen city of Troy banded 
                        together under Aeneas and underwent a series of adventures around the Mediterranean Sea, including a stop at newly founded Carthage under the rule of Queen Dido, eventually reaching the 
                        Italian coast.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>The Trojans were thought to have landed in an area between modern Anzio and Fiumicino, southwest of Rome, probably at Laurentum or, in other versions, at Lavinium, a place named for Lavinia, 
                        the daughter of King Latinus whom Aeneas married. This started a series of armed conflicts with Turnus over the marriage of Lavinia.</p>

                    <p>Before the arrival of Aeneas, Turnus was betrothed to Lavinia, who then married Aeneas, starting the war. Aeneas won the war and killed Turnus. The Trojans won the right to stay and to 
                        assimilate with the local peoples. The young son of Aeneas Ascanius, also known as Iulus, went on to found Alba Longa and the line of Alban kings who filled the chronological gap between the 
                        Trojan saga and the traditional founding of Rome in the 8th century BC.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Romulus and Remus</h2>
                <p>Romulus and Remus were purported to be sons of Rhea Silvia and either Mars, the god of war, or the demi-god hero Hercules. They were abandoned at birth, in the manner of many mythological heroes, 
                    because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their great-uncle Amulius, who had overthrown Silvia's father Numitor.</p>
                    
                <p>The twins were abandoned on the river Tiber by servants who took pity on the infants, despite their orders. The twins were nurtured by a she-wolf until a shepherd named Faustulus found the boys 
                    and took them as his sons. Faustulus and his wife Acca Larentia raised the children. When Remus and Romulus became adults, they killed Amulius and restored Numitor.</p>

                <p>They decided to establish a city; however, they quarreled, and Romulus killed his brother. Thus, Rome began with a fratricide, a story that was later taken to represent the city's history of 
                    internecine political strife and bloodshed.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Archaeology of the Roman area</h2>
                    <p>There is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from about 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites. 
                        Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the Bronze Age and 
                        the beginning of the Iron age, each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village. On the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>The location that became the city of Rome was inhabited by Latin settlers from various regions, as evidenced by differences in pottery and burial techniques. 
                        The historical Latins were originally an Italic tribe who inhabited the Alban Hills. They later moved down into the valleys, which provided better land for agriculture. The area 
                        around the Tiber was particularly advantageous and offered notable strategic resources: the river was a natural border on one side, and the hills could provide a safe defensive position 
                        on the other side. This position would also have enabled the Latins to control the river and the commercial and military traffic on it from the natural observation point at Isola 
                        Tiberina. Moreover, road traffic could be controlled, since Rome was at the intersection of the principal roads to the sea coming from Sabinum (in the northeast) and Etruria 
                        (to the northwest). 
                    </p>

                    <p>The city developed gradually through the aggregation of several villages around the largest one on the Palatine. This aggregation, was made possible by the increase in agricultural 
                        productivity above the minimally required level. Development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy was in turn also boosted due to this. All these events, which according 
                        to the archeological excavations occurred around the mid 8th century BC, can be considered as the origin of the city.
