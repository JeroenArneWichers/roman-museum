                <h2 class="title">Roman Senate</h2>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The Roman Senate functioned as an advisory body to Rome's 
                    magistrates and, composed as it was of the city's most experienced public servants and 
                    society's elite, its decisions carried great weight, even if they were not always converted 
                    into laws in practice. The Senate continued to exert influence on government in the 
                    imperial period, albeit to a lesser degree and despite the increase in the army's 
                    intervention in politics and its manipulation in both membership and sessions by successive 
                    emperors. The institution outlasted all emperors, and senators remained Rome's most powerful 
                    political movers, holding key public offices, influencing public opinion, commanding 
                    legions, and governing provinces.

                    <h2 class="title">Origins</h2>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">The Romans used the name senatus for their most important seat 
                        of government, which derives from senex meaning 'old' and meant 'assembly of old men' with 
                        a connotation of wisdom and experience. Members were sometimes referred to as 'fathers' 
                        or patres, and so this combination of ideas illustrates that the Senate was a body designed 
                        to provide reasoned and balanced guidance to the Roman state and its people.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">According to tradition, Rome's founder Romulus created the 
                        first 100-member Senate as an advisory body to the sovereign, but very little is know about 
                        its actual role in Rome's early history as a monarchy. In the early Republic, it is likely 
                        the body began as an advisory board to magistrates and then grew in power as retired 
                        magistrates joined it as indicated by the lex Ovinia (after 339 BCE but before 318 BCE) 
                        which set out that members should be recruited from the 'best men.' A new list of members 
                        was compiled every five years by the censors, but senators usually kept their role for 
                        life unless they had committed a dishonourable act. For example, in 70 BCE, no fewer 
                        than 64 senators were omitted from the new list for undignified conduct. The system was 
                        now in place which, in effect, created a new and powerful political class that would 
                        dominate Roman government for centuries.

                <h2 class="title">Membership</h2>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">From the 3rd century BCE there were 300 members of the Senate, 
                    and after the reforms of Sulla in 81 BCE, there were probably around 500 senators, although 
                    after that date there does not seem to have been either a specific minimum or maximum number. 
                    Julius Caesar instigated reforms in the mid-1st century BCE, gave out membership to his 
                    supporters, and extended it to include important individuals from cities other than Rome 
                    so that there were then 900 senators. Augustus subsequently reduced the membership to around 
                    600. The senators were led by the princeps senatus, who always spoke first in debates. 
                    The position became less important in the final years of the Republic, but it was brought 
                    back to prominence under Augustus.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="card-text text-justify">There is evidence that the Senate was not wholly composed of members of the aristocratic patrician 
                    class, even if they formed the majority of its members. Some non-senators - magistrates of certain 
                    kinds such as tribunes, aediles and later quaestors - could attend and speak in sessions of 
                    the Senate. Invariably, such members were made full senators in the next censorship. Naturally, 
                    not all members actively participated in sessions and many would simply have listened to 
                    the speeches and voted.
                </p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">The rank of senator carried with it certain privileges such as the right to wear a toga with a 
                    Tyrian purple stripe (latus clavus), a senatorial ring, special shoes, an epithet 
                    (later with three ranks: clarissimi, spectabiles, illustres), certain fiscal benefits, 
                    and the best seats at public festivals and games. There were restrictions too, with no 
                    senator being able to leave Italy without the Senate's approval, own large ships, or bid for 
                    state contracts.

                    <p class="card-text text-justify">The Senate met in various places in Rome or its outskirts within a 
                        mile of the city boundary, but the place had to be sacred, that is a templum. The obvious candidate 
                        was a temple, but the Senate most commonly met in the Curia, a public building in Rome. The first 
                        was the Curia Hostilia, used in the early kingdom, then the Curia Cornelia, built by Sulla, and 
                        finally the Curia Julia, built by Caesar, finished by Augustus and used thereafter. The sessions 
                        were open to the public with a literal open door policy that allowed people to sit outside and 
                        listen in if they wished.

                <h2 class="title">Legislation & Proceedings</h2>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The formal function of the Senate was to advise the magistrates 
                    (consuls, censors, quaestors, aediles, and so on) with decrees and resolutions. Its decisions were 
                    given further weight by the fact that many senators were themselves ex-magistrates with practical 
                    experience of governance, and so, in practice, vetoes were rare (but did occur by, for example, the 
                    tribunes of the popular assembly, the tribuni plebis). Magistrates also had to consider that they 
                    would themselves be back in the Senate after their one year of office. Upon implementation the decrees 
                    became law. Exceptionally, during the crises presented by the fall of the Republic, the Senate could 
                    and did issue emergency decrees (senatus consultum ultimum) it deemed necessary to protect the state.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="card-text text-justify">From the 4th century BCE, the Senate became increasingly influential on 
                    public policy as that of the popular assemblies and magistrates waned. The Senate decided on such 
                    matters as domestic policies, including financial and religious areas, first formulating proposals 
                    which only then did the popular assemblies have the opportunity to debate. Foreign policy was also 
                    considered such as hearing foreign ambassadors, deciding the distribution of the legions, and 
                    creating provinces and deciding their borders. Existing laws and their deficiencies could also 
                    be debated. In addition, the Senate had the power to shine prestige on Rome's most powerful men, 
                    notably in the award of triumphs for successful military campaigns.
                </p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">A record was kept of the proceedings (senatus consulta) and published 
                    for the public to consult in the public archive or Tabularium. The practice was stopped by Augustus. 
                    Senators could always access these records, though, and writers, who were almost always senators, 
                    were not shy to quote from them in their works.

                <h2 class="title">The Imperial Period</h2>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The Senate was still an influential body even after Augustus became emperor. 
                    Senators continued to debate and sometimes disapprove of the emperor's actions, and as the 
                    historian F.Santangelo notes, the Senate "retained important prerogatives in military, fiscal, and 
                    religious matters, and appointed the governors of the provinces that were not under the direct 
                    control of Augustus" (Bagnall, 6142). Certain law cases involving non-senators as well as senators 
                    (e.g. bribery, extortion, and crimes against the people) were decided by the Senate and their ruling 
                    could not be overturned by the emperor.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="card-text text-justify">The Senate remained a prestigious body with important ceremonial and 
                    symbolic powers, membership of which was still the aspiration of Rome's elite citizens, now accessible 
                    to new members only via election to the quaestorship (20 per year). Augustus introduced a minimum 
                    property qualification for membership and then created a senatorial order whereby only sons of senators 
                    or those given the status by the emperor could become senators. Over the centuries, as the empire 
                    expanded so too did the geographical origins of the senators until, by the 3rd century CE, up to 
                    50% of senators came from outside Italy.
                </p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">In practice, despite their continued influence and prestige, the senators' 
                    powers had greatly diminished compared to in the Republic at its height. A small group of senators was now 
                    appointed by the emperor (consilium) which decided what exactly would be debated by the full Senate, which 
                    Augustus himself sometimes chaired in person. Tiberius (r. 14-37 CE) was another keen attendee, but he 
                    dispensed with the consilium, even if many subsequent emperors formed a similar informal advisory panel 
                    which included some senators. Real political power was in the hands of the emperors, but the Senate, nevertheless, 
                    continued to pass a large quantity of legislation during the Principate. Another important influence was 
                    the speeches made by senators, but when emperors started to make these themselves (orationes), they were 
                    subsequently quoted by jurists, suggesting they may have had, in practical terms, the force of law. Augustus 
                    also set a time limit on speeches made by anyone except the emperor. The Senate might have become less influential, 
                    but emperors were still formally given their power of office by it, and therefore their legitimacy to rule. 
                    The Senate could also have the ultimate last word on an emperor's reign by declaring them a public enemy or 
                    officially erasing their memory (damnatio memoriae).

                <h2 class="title">Threats to the Senate</h2>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">There were direct challenges to the authority of the Senate besides those arising 
                    from Rome's everyday system of government. In the 70s BCE a rival body was set up in Spain by Sertorius and the 
                    Senate itself was often split into factions during the death throes of the Republic when large groups of senators 
                    sided with the most powerful men of the time such as Marius, Pompey, and Caesar. A great many senators also 
                    fell foul of the political machinations of these men of ambition and were expelled from the Senate or worse.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="card-text text-justify">Throughout the imperial period most emperors recognised that the Senate was an 
                    important voice of the elite of Rome and a reflection of their necessary involvement in the functioning of the 
                    empire, but their very attendance, the importance given to imperial speeches, and the moving away from acclamation 
                    instead of actual voting to pass legislation suggests that the Senate steadily declined as a forum of genuine 
                    political debate.
                </p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">Reforms by Diocletian (284-305 CE) and Constantine (306-337 CE) transferred many public 
                    positions from the senators to the equestrians or at least blurred the distinction between the two classes. The 
                    Late Empire then saw the momentous decision to split the Senate into two bodies, one in Rome and the other in 
                    Constantinople. As the emperor now resided in the latter city, the Senate of Rome became only concerned with 
                    local matters. The Senate continued on, though, and even outlasted the Roman Empire itself, but it would never 
                    regain the power and prestige it had enjoyed in the middle centuries of the Republic before Rome became dominated 
                    by individuals of vast wealth and military power.
