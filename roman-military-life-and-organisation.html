                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Roman legionaries were among the most ruthlessly efficient soldiers 
                                in the ancient world. But even for these highly disciplined and well-equipped men, the 
                                armies that conquered half of Europe, daily life was far from glamorous.

                            <h4 class="card-title text-left">Getting Up</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Gaius wakes up early in the room he shares with the other seven 
                                men of his squad. Part of a long barracks block, it’s just big enough for their bunk beds. 
                                They have another room in the block, meant for storing equipment, though he’s been tempted 
                                to sleep there on nights when Carausius’s snoring got too loud.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">After dressing in his tunic, belt and sandals, Gaius heads down 
                                to a room at the end of the barracks block. Here there is a fire burning in a hearth, chasing 
                                away some of the miserable cold of Britannia. Other early risers are making porridge and 
                                Gaius joins them. Most of their meals are like this – flour used to make porridge or bread, 
                                with a few beans or vegetables in the evening and some meat on good days. The army marches on grain.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">By the time everyone’s up, Gaius has finished eating and started donning 
                                his armor. Then it’s off to the parade ground for the morning muster. Three men are missing, not 
                                bad given the sickness that comes with this awful weather. Once they’ve been counted and inspected, 
                                everyone is assigned their daily tasks.

                            <h4 class="card-title">Fatigues</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">This morning, Gaius has duty at the bath house. It’s not the best 
                                job to have, but far from the worst.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The worst is latrine duty. Cleaning the pipes from the latrine block 
                                to the pits, and then emptying out those pits if they’re full, is the most disgusting thing he has 
                                to do outside the battlefield. Cleaning and maintaining the bathhouse, though sometimes as labor 
                                intensive, isn’t anywhere near as bad. It feels good to be working with his hands like his father 
                                did, replacing cracked tiles and pipes.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The best sort of duty is “boots” – equipment maintenance. It’s good 
                                to have the time to fix his kit and make sure it’ll serve him well in future. Gaius takes a lot 
                                of pride in his kit – after all, it’s the only thing here that’s truly his. Even being given 
                                officers’ kit to maintain isn’t bad, as he gets to sit down and stay active. Some men prefer 
                                guard duty, standing for hours without having to do anything, but for Gaius, that’s just boring.
                            </p>

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">This camp’s commander is the greatest sticklers for training 
                                Gaius has ever encountered. Despite the pleas of senators, he’s been at plenty of bases where 
                                training was a rare break from the monotony of camp chores and administration. Here, it’s a 
                                regular event.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">While some soldiers are sent out on patrol and to deal with a legal 
                                dispute in the nearby town, Gaius and his squad are led out onto the training field outside of 
                                camp. With only the afternoon to work in, they have marching drills, javelin practice, and 
                                combat with blunt weapons. Facing off against Carausius, Gaius takes the opportunity to give 
                                his comrade a good wallop around the head – punishment for all that snoring. By the looks 
                                of Carausius’s helmet, Gaius isn’t the only one.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">In the summer, they might spend whole days training. Then there 
                                will be marches into the countryside, mock battles, and even some construction work, practicing 
                                building a fortified camp in hostile territory. For today, though, it’s the regular stuff.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">There are auxiliaries training nearby, and Gaius takes a moment 
                                to watch. Their cavalry gallop up and down a track, throwing javelins at straw targets from 
                                horseback. Archers and slingers then step up to shoot at those same targets. Gaius is glad 
                                he’s a legionary, not an auxiliary. The pay, the equipment, and even the status of his 
                                job are far better.

                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Today there is a rare treat – the annual ceremony honoring 
                                    the memory of the divine Julius Caesar. Almost everyone in camp is gathered near the end 
                                    of the day, buglers calling them to attention on the parade ground. Hundreds of men in 
                                    gleaming armor, weapons at their sides and shields in hand, standing straight and proud.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">The commander, a senator of the Julian clan, talks at length 
                                    about the greatness of Caesar, how he saved Rome from corruption and barbarity. Gaius has 
                                    heard it all before, but he’s happy to stand through it for what comes next.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">At last, a huge bull is led out into the center of the parade 
                                    ground. Though sacrifices are made for dozens of festivals each year, this is the one 
                                    where their commander spares no expense. While centurions hold the beast in place, the 
                                    commander slits the bull’s throat, praying as he does so. Then they all pray together.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Half an hour later, the bull is roasting over an open fire, 
                                    the delicious smell filling the camp. Gaius waits eagerly with his comrades. It’s been a 
                                    long, hard day of work. He’s looking forward to this.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">A month later, the legion is on the march.
                                In some ways, life is now very different. Gaius spends a large part of the day marching, 
                                wearing through the brass studs of his sandals. He carries with him all his armor, 
                                weapons, and tools for building camp, as well as a bag of flour.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Every afternoon they build a rampart around a different camp 
                                site, then make their meal from those bags of flour. Sooner or later, there may be a battle 
                                or a village to burn, but mostly life is just marching.In some ways, it’s the same as at base. 
                                He shares a tent with the same seven men. He marches with them, talks with them, trains with 
                                them. If they’re given foraging or guard duty then they do it together. There are still 
                                latrine pits to be dug and equipment to be mended.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">In camp or on campaign, legion life is just as unexciting for Gaius.
