                <p class="card-text text-justify">In many societies, ancient and modern, religion has performed a 
                    major role in their development, and the Roman Empire was no different. From the beginning Roman 
                    religion was polytheistic. From an initial array of gods and spirits, Rome added to this collection 
                    to include both Greek gods as well as a number of foreign cults. As the empire expanded, the 
                    Romans refrained from imposing their own religious beliefs upon those they conquered; however, 
                    this inclusion must not be misinterpreted as tolerance - this can be seen with their early 
                    reaction to the Jewish and Christian population. Eventually, all of their gods would be washed 
                    away, gradually replaced by Christianity, and in the eyes of some, this change brought about the 
                    decline of the western empire.

                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Early forms of the Roman religion were animistic in nature, 
                        believing that spirits inhabited everything around them, people included. The first citizens 
                        of Rome also believed they were watched over by the spirits of their ancestors. Initially, 
                        a Capitoline Triad (possibly derived from a Sabine influence) were added to 
                        these “spirits" - the new gods included Mars, the god of war and supposed father of Romulus 
                        and Remus (founders of Rome); Quirinus, the deified Romulus who watched over the people of 
                        Rome; and lastly, Jupiter, the supreme god. They, along with the spirits, were worshipped 
                        at a temple on Capitoline Hill. Later, due to the Etruscans, the triad would change to 
                        include Jupiter who remained the supreme god; Juno, his wife and sister; and Minerva, 
                        Jupiter’s daughter.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Due to the presence of Greek colonies on the Lower Peninsula, 
                        the Romans adopted many of the Greek gods as their own. Religion and myth became one. Under 
                        this Greek influence, the Roman gods became more anthropomorphic – with the human 
                        characteristics of jealousy, love, hate, etc. However, this transformation was not to the 
                        degree that existed in Greek mythology. In Rome individual expression of belief was 
                        unimportant, strict adherence to a rigid set of rituals was far more significant, thereby 
                        avoiding the hazards of religious zeal. Cities adopted their own patron deities and performed 
                        their own rituals. Temples honoring the gods would be built throughout the empire; however, 
                        these temples were considered the “home” of the god; worship occurred outside the temple. 
                        While this fusion of Roman and Greek deities influenced Rome in many ways, their religion 
                        remained practical.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Even though there were four colleges for priests, there was 
                        no priestly class; it would always remain a public office. This practice would even extend 
                        to the imperial palace. From the time of Emperor Augustus the emperor would assume the title 
                        of pontifex maximus or chief priest. Other than the pontifexes there were augures, individuals 
                        who read the entrails of animals and the flight of birds to interpret omens, or in other 
                        words, the will of the gods. Elaborate rituals were performed to bring Roman victory in 
                        battle, and no declaration of war or major event was undertaken without the clear approval 
                        of the gods. Dating from the time of the Etruscans, a diviner or haruspices, was always 
                        consulted, and it was considered dangerous to ignore the omens. Spurinna, a Roman soothsayer, 
                        read animal entrails and foresaw Julius Caesar’s death on the Ides of March. When Roman 
                        Commander Publius Claudius Pulcher ignored the omens - refusal of the sacred chickens to 
                        eat - before a battle during the First Punic War, he was defeated, as was his military career.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">As the empire expanded across the Balkans, Asia Minor and into 
                        Egypt, Roman religion absorbed many of the gods and cults of conquered nations, but the 
                        primary influence would always remain Greece. With only a few exceptions, most of the Roman 
                        gods had their Greek counterparts. This Roman mythology would have a significant influence 
                        on the empire - politically and socially - as well as on the future of western civilization. 
                        One needs only to look at the names of the days and months (Tuesday, Saturday, January and 
                        June), the languages of European nations, and the names of the planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
                        and Pluto) to realize this influence.

                <h2 class="title">The Roman Pantheon</h2>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">While the study of Roman mythology tends to emphasize the major gods - 
                    Jupiter, Neptune (god of the sea), Pluto (god of the underworld) and Juno - there existed, of course, 
                    a number of “minor” gods and goddesses such as Nemesis, the god of revenge; Cupid, the god of love; 
                    Pax, the god of peace; and the Furies, goddesses of vengeance.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="card-text text-justify">However, when looking at the religion of Rome, one must examine the 
                    impact of the most important gods. Foremost among the gods were, of course, Jupiter, the Roman 
                    equivalent of Zeus (although not as playful), and his wife/sister Juno. He was the king of the 
                    gods; the sky god (the great protector) - controlling the weather and forces of nature, using 
                    thunderbolts to give warning to the people of Rome. Originally linked with farming as Jupiter 
                    Elicius, his role changed as the city grew, eventually obtaining his own temple on Capitoline 
                    Hill. Later, he became Jupiter Imperator Invictus Triumphator - Supreme General, Unconquered, 
                    and ultimately, Jupiter Optimus Maximus - Best and Greatest. His supremacy would be temporarily 
                    set aside during the reign of Emperor Elagabalus who attempted to replace the religion of Rome 
                    with that of the Syrian god Elagabal. After the emperor’s assassination, his successor, Alexander 
                    Severus, returned Jupiter to his former glory. Next, Jupiter’s wife/sister was Juno, for whom the 
                    month of June is named - she was the equivalent of the Greek Hera. Besides being the supreme 
                    goddess with a temple on Esquiline Hill, she was the goddess of light and moon, embodying all 
                    of the virtues of Roman matron hood - as Juno Lucina she became the goddess of childbirth 
                    and fertility.
                </p>

                <p class="card-text text-justify">After Juno comes Minerva, the Roman name for Athena (the patron 
                    goddess of Athens), and Mars, the god of war. According to legend, Minerva sprang from Jupiter’s 
                    head fully formed. She was the goddess of commerce, industry, and education. Later, she would 
                    be identified as a war goddess as well as the goddess of doctors, musicians and craftsmen. 
                    Although no longer one of the Capitoline triad, Mars remained an important god to Rome - similar 
                    to Ares, the Greek god of war. As Mars the Avenger, this son of Juno and her relationship with 
                    a flower, had a temple dedicated to him by Emperor Augustus, honoring the death of Julius 
                    Caesar’s assassins. Roman commanders would make sacrifices to him before and after battles and 
                    Tuesday (Martes) is named for him.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">There are a number of lesser gods (all with temples built to them) - 
                    Apollo, Diana, Saturn, Venus, Vulcan, and Janus. Apollo had no Roman equal and he was simply the 
                    Greek god of poetry, medicine, music, and science. He was originally brought to the city by the 
                    Etruscans to ward off the plague and was rewarded with a temple on Palatine Hill. Diana, Apollo’s 
                    Roman sister equivalent to the Greek Artemis, was not only the goddess of wild beasts and the 
                    harvest moon but also the goddess of the hunt. She was seen as a protector of women in childbirth 
                    with a temple at Ephesus in Asia Minor. Another god brought to the Rome by the Etruscans was 
                    Saturn, an agricultural god equal to the Greek Cronus and who had been expelled from heaven by 
                    Jupiter. A festival in his honor, the Saturnalia, was held yearly between the 17th and 23rd of 
                    December. His temple, at the foot of Capitoline Hill, housed the public treasury and decrees of 
                    the Senate. Another Roman goddess was Venus, who was born, according to myth, from the foam of 
                    the sea, equal to the Greek Aphrodite. According to Homer, she was the mother of Aenaes the hero of 
                    the Trojan War. Of course, the planet Venus is named for her. Next was Vulcan, also expelled from 
                    heaven by Jupiter, who was a lame (caused by his expulsion), ugly blacksmith and the god of fire. 
                    Lastly, there was Janus who had no Greek equal. He was the two-faced guardian of doorways and public 
                    gates. Janus was valued for his wisdom and was the first god mentioned in a person’s prayer; because 
                    of his two faces he could see both the past and the future.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">One cannot forget the Vestal Virgins who had no Greek counterpart. 
                    They were the guardians of the public hearth at the Atrium Vesta. They were girls chosen only from 
                    the patrician class at the tender age of six, beginning their service to the goddess Vesta at the 
                    age of ten and for the next thirty years they would serve her. While serving as a Vestal Virgin, a 
                    girl/woman was forbidden to marry and had to remain chaste. Some chose to remain in service to Vesta 
                    after serving their thirty years since, at the age of forty, they were considered too old to marry. 
                    Breaking the vow of chastity would result in death - only twenty would break the vow in over one 
                    thousand years. Emperor Elagabalus attempted to marry a vestal virgin but was convinced otherwise.

                    <h2 class="title">Cult Worship</h2>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Besides the worship of these gods there were several cults - Bacchus, 
                        Cybele, Isis, Sarapis, Sibyl, and most of all the Imperial Cult. Some were readily accepted by 
                        Roman society while others were feared by those in power. Bacchus was a Roman deity associated with 
                        both the Greek god Dionysus and the early Roman god Liber Patri, also a wine god. Bacchus is best 
                        remembered for his intoxicating festivals held on March 17, a day when a Roman male youth would 
                        supposedly become a man. As his cult spread, the Roman Senate realized its dangerous potential and 
                        ordered its suppression in 186 BCE and afterwards, the cult went underground.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Another cult centered on Cybele, the “great mother” - a fertility goddess 
                        with a temple on Palatine Hill who was responsible for every aspect of a person’s well-being. The goddess 
                        arrived in Athens in the fifth century BCE and first appeared in Rome during the Punic Wars. All of 
                        her priests were eunuchs, and many of her male followers would have themselves castrated. Next is 
                        Isis, the ancient goddess of Egypt who is best remembered in Egyptian mythology as the wife of Osiris 
                        and the mother of Horus. After becoming Hellenized, she became the protector of sailors and fishermen. 
                        Arriving in Rome from Alexandria, Sarpis was a healing god and the sick would travel to her temple 
                        to be cured. Sibyl was a priestess of the Greek and Roman god Apollo who came to Rome from the 
                        Greek colony of Cumae.  She offered the Etruscan King Tarquin the nine Sibylline Books which were 
                        books of prophecy, but the price was considered too high, so he refused. After she had burned six 
                        of the books, he reconsidered and bought the remaining three; these three books were consulted by 
                        the Roman Senate in times of emergencies but they were lost during the barbarian invasions of the 
                        fifth century CE.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">Lastly, there was the Imperial Cult. The idea of deification of the 
                        emperor came during the time of Emperor Augustus. He resisted the Senate’s attempts to name him a 
                        god during his reign as he thought himself the son of a god, not a god. Upon his death, the Roman 
                        Senate rewarded him with deification which was an honor that would be bestowed upon many of his 
                        successors. Often, an emperor would request his predecessor to be deified. Of course there were a 
                        few exceptions, notably, Tiberius, Caligula, Nero and Domitian, who were considered too abhorrent 
                        to receive the honor. Caligula and Nero believed themselves living gods while Domitian thought 
                        himself the reincarnation of Hercules.

                <p class="card-text text-justify">Judaism and Christianity, while posing separate threats to the empire, 
                    had one thing in common - they both refused to participate in the worship of the Roman gods and make 
                    sacrifices at their temples. Although the Jews had firmly established themselves in the empire, they 
                    were often the target of the emperors, often blamed for any ills that befell the empire. Nero had them 
                    expelled from Rome, and Titus, the son of Emperor Vespasian, would continue his father’s war against 
                    the Jews in the Jewish Wars, eventually destroying the city of Jerusalem and killing thousands of its 
                    citizens.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="card-text text-justify">Although Christianity was initially seen as a sect of Judaism, Emperor 
                    Nero grew more suspicious as this small sect began to grow, especially after the Great Fire of Rome; 
                    he even blamed them for the fire. They returned the favor, calling him the anti-Christ. As time passed, 
                    Christianity continued to spread across the empire, appealing to women and slaves as well as 
                    intellectuals and the illiterate. Persecutions increased where Christian churches were burned and 
                    all of this continued under the reign of Diocletian (emperor in the east), ending in the Great 
                    Persecution. To many, Christians offended the pax deorum or “peace of the gods".

                <p class="card-text text-justify">Finally, under Diocletian’s successor Emperor Constantine, Christianity 
                    would finally receive recognition in the Edict of Milan in 313 CE. Constantine’s benevolence towards 
                    Christianity can be traced to the Battle of Milvan Bridge in 312 CE where he beheld a vision (a cross 
                    in the sky), enabling him to be victorious and become the emperor of a united Roman Empire. Later, 
                    in 325 CE he held the Council of Nicaea, reconciling the differences between the various Christian 
                    sects. He rebuilt the churches destroyed by Diocletian, and according to some sources, converted to 
                    Christianity on his deathbed (his mother was a Christian). After his death Christianity would continue 
                    to grow and eventually overshadow and replace the traditional Roman religion and Rome would even 
                    become the new center of Christianity. However, in the end, Christianity would still receive blame 
                    for the ills of the empire. In his book The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire 
                    Edward Gibbon blamed, in part, the fall of the empire on Christianity. In his eyes it absorbed the 
                    energy of the people making them unable to suffer through the adversities that plagued the empire. 
                    Yet, despite its highs and lows, from the days of the spirits inhabiting all things through the 
                    Roman/Greek gods and emperor deification to Christianity, religion always remained an important 
                    part of Roman society.
