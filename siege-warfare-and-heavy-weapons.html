                            <h4 class="card-title">The legacy of the Greeks</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">It is often asserted that, where machinery is concerned, the Romans
                                displayed litle inventive genius. Vitruvius, the Roman architect-engineer
                                who wrote a work 'On architecture' (De architectura) around 25 Bc, laments
                                the fact that so many of his sources are Greeks and so few Romans.
                                However, the development of water power, for example, shows that the
                                Romans were keen to adopt existing Greek technology and apply it in ever
                                more ingenious ways.
                              </p>
                              <p class="card-text text-justify">Their acquaintance with artillery during the course of the First: Punic
                                War (264-241 Bc) appears to have been brief, and their use of the weapon
                                during the Second Punic War (218-201 8C) was the result of confiscation
                                rather than manufacture. Some of the machines found in Roman hands
                                were seized from the Carthaginians; for example, their capture of
                                Cartagena in 210 BC reportedly brought the Romans a huge haul of
                                war material, including ‘120 catapults of the largest sort, 281 smaller ones,
                                23 large ballistae, 52 smaller ones, and large and small scorpions’. Other
                                catapults were no doubt requisitioned from the Greek towns of Sicily, one
                                of the main theatres of the war. Certainly, according to Livy (a close
                                contemporary of Vitruvius), the Roman capture of Syracuse in 211 Bc 
                                brought ‘catapults and bailistae and all the other equipment of war’,
                                showing that the town had remained at the forefront of military technology.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Roman stocks of artillery would have been further replenished with
                                the booty from campaigning in Greece during wars with Macedon
                                (200-196 Bc), Sparta (195 Bc), and the Aetolian Confederacy (191-189
                                Bc). Mural artillery was becoming increasingly common in towns of the
                                Mediterranean world, as engineers took their knowledge wherever people
                                could pay for it. Catapults mentioned on board ships at this ime were
                                probably supplied by Rhodes and Pergamon, Rome’s naval allies against
                                Macedon, but the ‘catapults, ballistae, and artillery of all sorts’ that
                                appeared in the triumphal procession of 187 BC in Rome were surely
                                booty seized from the Aetolians.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Roman armies continued to use artillery in a piecemeal fashion,
                                generally requisitioning machines whenever necessary. It is only with
                                the campaigns of Julius Caesar in the 50s Bc that we finally gain the
                                impression of artillery as standard equipment, with at least lightweight
                                arrow-firers regularly accompanying the legions. Although still chiefly
                                used in siege warfare, these weapons found more imaginative
                                employment in Caesar's hands; in defence of camp, for example, or on
                                board ships in support of amphibious landings.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">It is into this context that the most famous artillery find of all
                                should be set. In 1912, the complete iron-clad spring-frame of a slightly
                                undersized three-span arrow-firer came to light at Ampurias in Spain.
                                More recently, another two spring-frames were discovered in Spain. The
                                first, from Azaila, is apparently now lost, apart from one washer; the
                                spring-diameter of 9.4cm suggests a four-span machine. The other, from
                                Caminreal, is technically a 34%span machine, but the 8.4cm washers are
                                slightly too large, and must have been used either in error or out of
                                necessity.

                            <h4 class="card-title">Vitruvius’s arrow-firer</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">By the 20s Bc, when Vitruvius came to describe the arrow-firer in his                   
                                general survey of machinery, one or two significant changes had been
                                made to the old euthytone. Of course, in place of the daktyl, Roman
                                measurements used the marginally smaller digit. But, more importantly, a
                                new Latin vocabulary was intoduced for components that, until now, had
                                been known by Greek names. In particular, the spring-diameter, diametros,
                                came to be known as the foramen, and the washer (choinix in Greek) was
                                now the modiolus. Also, Latin authors tended to use the collective term
                                tormenta (torsion engines) for artillery, with arrow-firers individually
                                designated catapultae (from the Greek term, katapeltai oxybeleis), except for
                                small-calibre models, which evidently attracted the term scorpio (scorpion).
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Terminology was not the only change. Vitruvius’s text highlights a
                                fundamental difference in the shape and design of the arrow-firer's spring-
                                frame. Where Philon’s upnghts were 3% spring-diameters high, Vitruvius
                                specifies 4 diameters, and where Philon’s peritréta were 6% spring-diameters
                                long, Vitruvius specifies only 6 diameters. Thus, the Vitruvian spring-frame
                                was narrower and taller. The saving in width was achieved by a refinement
                                of design, as can be seen in the Ampurias and Caminreal machines.
                                Philon’s twin central uprights, which flanked the syrinx to create a firm
                                bond between spring-frame and catapult stock, were removed. In their
                                place, Vitruvius’s spring-frame (called the capitulum, or ‘capital’) had a
                                single central upright, with two apertures; one, to allow the slider to run
                                forward, and another below it, which can only have been intended for
                                wedging the syrinx (now called the canaliculus, or ‘channel’) in place.
                                </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Also, it seems that, through time, the profile of the washers became
                                gradually higher in relation to the diameter. The type 3 washers from
                                Ephyra, for example, are 0.4 diametros high; these are thought to be
                                amongst the earliest to use the pin-hole locking system, and could be 3rd
                                century BC in date. By contrast, the type 5 Ephyra washers are 0.5 diametros
                                high, as are the slightly larger Ampurias washers, both of these are
                                presumed to be mid-2nd century Bc. The Caminreal washers, from the Ist
                                century BC, are 0.6 foramen high, like the contemporary Mahdia washers,
                                while those found at Cremona, dating a century or so later, are 0.7 foramen
                                high. It is clear that the ratio between spring-diameter and washer height
                                was gradually increasing, so Vitruvius’s springs no longer adhered to
                                Philon’s proportions.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">A further development involved the curving of the catapulta’s
                                bow-arms, so that, at rest, the tips were further forward than their straight-
                                arm predecessor. This effectively increased the angle of recoil from 35
                                degrees to 47 degrees, and meant that, on spanning, more energy could
                                be stored in the springs. Both of these changes must have produced a
                                more powerful machine.</p>

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Although Greek authors continued to use the terms lithobolos and
                                petrobolos, under the Romans the stone-projector became known as the
                                ballista. For this machine, we are totally reliant on Vitruvius’s description,
                                because archaeology has failed to provide the kind of supplementary
                                evidence that has aided the interpretation of the catapulta. This is
                                unfortunate, as Vitruvius’s text has suffered badly in transmission, and
                                ambiguity surrounds the interpretation of several key passages.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">One of these passages concerns the correlation of machine size to
                                missile weight. Like the old stone-projector, each individual ballista was tailored to the 
                                appropriate missile, and the crucial measurement
                                was, of course, the spring-diameter. Vitruvius duly lists a series of weights
                                in librae (Roman pounds), each with a corresponding foramen. However,
                                where Philon and Heron quote the Greek conversion formula as the
                                source of their measurements, Vitruvius claims that he drew his infor-
                                mation from personal experience and from his teachers, supplemented
                                with calculations ‘made by the Greeks but converted to the Roman system’.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Scholars have often thought it curious that Vitruvius’s weights are
                                paired with much smaller spring-diameters than the Greek formula would
                                suggest. Drachmann pointed to Vitruvius’s recommendation of 10-digit
                                (185mm) springs for a 20-pound (6.55kg) missile; Philon would have used
                                12%dactyl (240mm) springs for the same weight (15 minas). Drachmann
                                realised that there were three possible explanations for this: perhaps
                                Vitruvius was mistaken; or the Romans used under-powered machines; or
                                their springs were somehow more efficient. He decided that, since the
                                Roman author Heron quoted the same Greek formula as Philon, it must
                                sull have applied in Roman times, and the fault must le with Vitruvius.
                                But, of course, Heron was simply quoting the work of Ctesibius, from the
                                days before even Philon; his catapults were of Greek, not Roman, design.
                                Equally, Vitruvius is unlikely to have made such a fundamental error
                                as quoting dimensions in digiti (l6ths of a foot) when he meant unciae
                                (12ths of a foot), as Marsden suggested. And, since it is unthinkable that
                                the Romans would have been satisfied with under-powered machines, it
                                seems that their ballistae really were more efficient than the old stone-
                                projectors of the Greeks. How was this achieved?
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Apart from possible improvements in spring material, about
                                which we know very little, greater efficiency could have come from an
                                increase in spring volume. Vitruvius’s description shows that the ballista’s
                                spring-frame was built to roughly the same proportions as the old
                                stone-pro-jector’s, but there is good reason to suppose that the springs
                                were thicker.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">In his description of the peritréton (which, for the ballista alone, he also
                                calls the scutula, or ‘diamond’), Vitruvius claims that the spring-hole
                                should be oval rather than circular, and that the amount of elongation
                                should offset the area occupied by the washer’s lever (epizygis). However,
                                Schramm pointed out that an oval spring-hole would make it impossible
                                to turn the washer and twist the torsion-spring; he suggested that it
                                was the upper rim of the washer that was oval, the lower rim remaining
                                circular. Although this would be difficult to manufacture, the design
                                makes perfect sense; in the standard cylindrical washer, the presence of
                                the lever across the upper rim restricts the amount of spring-cord that can
                                be forced through the spring-hole; in effect, there will always be a vacant
                                space beneath the lever. But, by splaying the washer internally, the space
                                occupied by the lever can be reclaimed and the spring-hole can be
                                entirely filled with spring-cord.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">It would seem, then, that more densely packed spring-cord allowed
                                Roman engineers to build smaller ballistae for heavier missiles. The largest
                                ballista in regular Roman service was probably the 80-pounder, which shot
                                a 26kg missile. This was equivalent to the old-style 1-talent stone-projector,
                                for which the Greek formula gives a diametros of 20 daktyls (38.5cm).
                                (Philon’s text actually reads KA, or kappa alpha/20 + 1 in the alphabetic
                                system, which may have been an attempt to slightly increase the size of this
                                heavy-duty machine.) At any rate, its springs were 3.47m high, its stock
                                over 7m long, and the distance from the tip of one arm to the up of the
                                other well over 5 m. By contrast, Vitruvius gives his machine a foramen of
                                17% digits (32.4cm), which results in springs only 2.82m high, and a
                                machine whose overall size was a metre smaller than Philon’s in length
                                and width.

                                Judaicum) around ap 75, describes the artillery of the imperial legions in
                                action. In Ab 67, no fewer than 160 catapults were deployed, alongside
                                archers and slingers, for the future emperor Vespasian’s assault on
                                Jotapata. These included arrow-firers shooting incendiary missiles, and
                                massive l-talent (26kg) stone-projectors. The latter perhaps belonged to
                                Legion X Fretensis, which famously besieged Masada in Ab 74. That
                                legion’s one-talent machines were apparently the largest ballistae at
                                Jerusalem, during the siege of Ab 70. Josephus claims that the huge white
                                ballista balls had to be blackened, so that the defenders could not track
                                their long approach and take evasive action.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">During the civil war that brought Vespasian to the throne, his
                                enemies deployed artillery for the night battle outside Cremona in AD
                                69. The writer Tacitus’s story of how two soldiers managed to disable a
                                large stone-projector is one of the last explicit references to the stone-throwing ballista. 
                                But more graphical evidence of the battle comes from
                                the archaeological remains. All eight washers and two front shields (one
                                very fragmentary) from two arrow-firers were discovered in a pit near
                                the battlefield, where they had perhaps been hidden by scavengers.
                                The foramina of the washers indicate a 3-span machine and a larger one
                                of around 2/ft.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">It was long ago realised that the catapults depicted on Trajan’s Column
                                differed noticeably from those on earlier relief sculpture. The column's
                                yreat spiral frieze depicts the events of Trajan’s Dacian Wars (AD 101-2
                                and 105-6), and was sculpted during the period prior to its official
                                dedication in Ad 13. Thus the new design of catapult must have been
                                introduced before that date.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Schramm believed that ‘Trajan’s catapults differed from earlier
                                machines in only one respect, namely that the torsion-springs were
                                apparently enclosed in weatherproof cilinders. But it was left to Marsden
                                to elucidate the true nature of the redesign, which involved nothing less
                                than the abandonment of the old euthytone design, last glimpsed on the
                                Vedennius tombstone of the Ad 80s or 90s. Henceforth, the arrow-firer
                                would have separate springs, like the palintone stone-projector, and it
                                duly became known, somewhat confusingly, as a ballista.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The clue to the identity of the new arrow-firing ballista lies in a dark and
                                difficult Greek text entitled ‘Construction and dimensions of Heron's
                                cheiroballistra’. Its dating is not certain, though scholars have generally
                                been at pains to dissociate it from the Ist-century Heron of Alexandria.
                                (The author is sometimes dubbed Pseudo-Heron to emphasise this.)
                                The argument rests chiefly on the grounds that, as the machine only
                                appears after AD 100, a Neronian engineer cannot have written about it,
                                and it must be admitted that the chronology would be a litle tight.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The importance of the text rests upon Marsden’s realisation that
                                the machine it describes, the cheiroballistra or ‘hand ballista’ (the Latin
                                form, manuballista, is found elsewhere), closely resembles the artillery
                                depicted on Trajan’s Column. The text actually consists of a list: of
                                component parts with their dimensions, rather than proper assembly
                                instructions. In summary, there is a stock, comprising the familiar pipe
                                and slider, and incorporating a crescent-shaped fitting at the rear; a
                                trigger mechanism, fitted to the slider; a pair of frames called kambestria
                                (Marsden’s ‘field-frames’); four washers with levers; two) struts, one
                                arched (kamarion) and one laddered (klimakion); and two bow-arms.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Marsden realised that each kambestrion, comprising two iron rings
                                held apart by two iron posts, was intended to hold a torsion-spring, just
                                like the individual springs of the palintone stone-projector. (Like
                                Schramm, he enclosed each spring in a thin metal cylinder, but the
                                sculptural evidence of Trajan’s Column is ambiguous on this point.)
                                Marsden further reasoned that the two struts, the kamarion and klimakion,
                                took the place of the wooden framework of the stone-projector, and were
                                intended to link the two kambestria. In fact, the struts each terminate in
                                a pair of brackets, whose forked ends are the same distance apart as the
                                iron uprights of the kambestria. Marsden cleverly drew the conclusion
                                that these brackets were intended to grip the ‘field-frames’ at the top
                                and bottom, and hold them in place.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">All of the components are reasonably easily deciphered, at least
                                with the benefit of Marsden’s analysis, vet the design of the chetroballistra
                                remains controversial. A strict reading of the text results in a very small
                                machine, as befits a hand weapon. For example, the stock measures
                                roughly one metre in length; the field-frames, 20.6cm high (11 1/6 daktyls)
                                with a 3.7cm (2 daktyls) spring-hole, are set 43.5cm (1ft. 7 1/2 daktyls) apart;
                                the bow-arms are only 20.4cm long (11 daktyls); and the washers have a
                                tiny spring-diameter of 2.5cm (1 1/3 daktyls).
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Although no components matching the dimensions in the text
                                have ever been found, small torsion-powered hand weapons are known
                                to have existed in the ancient world. The type 6 washer from Ephyra
                                has an inner diameter of 3.4cm; two slightly larger examples have
                                been discovered in Britain, one from Elginhaugh (3.5cm) and the
                                other from Bath (4.0cm); and two late Roman examples were found
                                at Volubilis in Morocco (4.1 and 4.4cm). Nevertheless, successive
                                commentators have tried to enlarge various components to make a
                                full-sized catapult, although it seems obvious that the cheiroballistra was
                                a hand-held weapon. In particular, the crescent-shaped fituing at
                                the rear of the stock served the same purpose as the stomach-rest of the
                                old gastraphetes.

                                of the German scholar Dietwulf Baatz, parts from iron-framed
                                catapults have gradually come to light from several late-Roman sites.

                                spring-holes (5.4, 5.9, 5.4cm); the single kambestrion from Lyon (France)
                                is much taller (32.5cm) and wider (spring-hole approx. 9cm); the one

                                basic relationship between spring-height and diameter, the same cannot
                                be said for the new-style iron-framed machines.

                                situng at either end, increased the overall spring-height and determined
                                the spring-diameter, It must be remembered that the old-style ballistas
                                spring-hole was recessed to receive the washer, and consequently
                                had the same spring-diameter; by contrast, the newsstvle  ballistas

                                the spring-hole is roughly 9em m= diameter, but the inner diameter
                                of the washers (and hence the spring-diameter) is only 7.5cm.
                                Furthermore, the washers are roughly 6cm high. making the total
                                spring height 44.5cm, equivalent to almost six spring-diameters. By
                                contrast, the cherroballistra washers sit 2.9cm (1 7/12 daktyls) above the
                                kambestrion, giving a spring-height of 26.4cm. which is more than ten
                                spring-diameters.

                                thev are clearly in the wrong place, facing inwards instead of backwards.
                                But, if their purpose is the same -— namely, to provide free space so that

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The soldier and writer Ammianus Marcellinus is a particularly valuable
                                source, as he witnessed many momentous events in the third quarter of
                                the 4th century AD. In a well-known digression, he attempts to describe
                                the siege-machinery and artillery of his own day, with varying success;
                                although his description of the ballista is incomprehensible, his remarks
                                on the one-armed stone-projector are fairly clear (though sull vague
                                enough to have spawned three different reconstructions).
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">In short, a single torsion-spring was mounted transversely in- a
                                recumbent timber frame. A single, wooden arm was slotted into the
                                spring halfway along, so that it stood upright and travelled in a vertical
                                arc; a sling attached to its free end released a stone when the arm
                                reached the top of the arc. Ammianus claims that the machine was
                                called the onager, or wild ass, because it kicked up stones; previously, it
                                had been known as the scorpio (scorpion), no doubt because of the
                                resemblance between the upright arm and the scorpion’s tail. (It is
                                clear that, across the centuries, artillery terminology gradually changed,
                                for in Vitruvius's day the scorpio was a light-calibre arrow-firer.)
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">In the absence of a bow-string, which arrested the arm movement in
                                the traditional two-armed catapult, this machine required a padded
                                buffer to stop the arm. Ammianus writes that, ‘in front of the wooden
                                structure [the onager], a huge buffer is spread out: namely, a sack stuffed
                                with fine chaff, secured with strong binding, and located on heaped
                                up turves or piles of bricks.” Marsden was misled by the philologist
                                Rudolf Schneider into believing that the entire machine sat on a pile
                                of turf or bricks; it seems, however, that Ammianus meant the buffer
                                alone was raised up in this way. This perhaps applied only to the larger
                                machines, such as the one that famously misfired at Maozamalcha in
                                AD 363, crushing the chief artilleryman with its stone.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">A turf buffer would have been a liability whenever the onager had
                                to be moved. Yet, Ammianus mentions no such upheaval in connection
                                with the nocturnal redeployment of four machines at Amida in
                                AD 359. In fact, for lighter models, the design proposed by Napoleon III's
                                general, Verchére de Reffye, would have been quite suitable; by
                                incorporating a separate timber-framed buffer, this design reduced the
                                overall weight of the onager and increased its manoeuvrability.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">In practical tests using miniature models, Michael Lewis demonstrated
                                the superiority of a forward-sloping buffer over the more familiar vertical
                                one. He was also able to establish that the length of the sling had a real
                                bearing on the range of the missile, and that, far from simply lobbing
                                stones in a high arc, the sling could be set to release its missile in a flat,
                                direct trajectory. Modern commentators often assume that the onager
                                represented a decline in ancient artillery, but they are confusing simplicity
                                with clumsiness. In fact, it seems to have been an efficient and easily
                                operated machine, and the single torsion-spring removed the need,
                                intrinsic to two-armed catapults, for fine-tuning and balancing a pair of
                                springs.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">A number of uncertainties still surround the subject of ancient artillery,
                                and a new generation of scholars is currently at work to solve
                                them, but the broad outlines are fairly clear. In 1930, Sir William
                                Tarn felt justified in writing that ‘no improvements, except in
                                details, were ever made upon the catapults of Demetrius’ time’, and
                                as recently as 1972 one critic could claim that, ‘under the Romans,
                                there were few genuine improvements in construction and efficiency’.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify"></p>
                                On the contrary, it is clear that the catapult continued to develop
                                and improve in its various forms, from the 4th century BC right up to
                                the 4th century AD.
