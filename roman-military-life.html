                            <p class="card-text text-justify">This man wears a bronze Montefortino type helmet and a long iron mail corslet with leather-backed shoulder
                                    reinforcements. His helmet crest might have been black as in earlier republican times, in some colour chosen
                                    by his general to distinguish his troops from civil war opponents, or red as adopted later. His tunic would
                                    probably be dyed red with madder, but the heavy recruitment and wear-and-tear of the civil wars might lead to
                                    him being found in the normal civilian tunic of mainly undyed wool, sometimes with coloured borders to
                                    individual taste.
                              </p>
                              <p class="card-text text-justify">His long oval shield is dished and has a wooden centre spine on the outside which enlarges into a metal
                                    covered boss protecting the central grip. It is made of plywood, covered and edged with thin leather, then
                                    painted in his unit’s special pattern. Shields varied in size and to a lesser extent in shape. Some were squared
                                    off at top and bottom and may have been conversions produced by cutting the ends short to increase
                                    handiness. Some examples depicted on monuments seem to have been trimmed to a greater extent at the top
                                    than at the bottom.
                              </p>
                              <p class="card-text text-justify">His primary armament is the Pilum, a heavy throwing spear with a small head and a long thin iron which was
                                    carried on inside the wooden shaft to a considerable depth. It was flung immediately before contact, its narrow
                                    head and weight, plus the short range, giving it a good chance of penetrating metal armour, or of lodging in
                                    and encumbering an opponent’s shield as the Legionarius followed up with his sword. The Legionarius’
                                    sword at this period was the Gladius, about two feet long, double-edged, pointed and rather heavy. It is
                                    usually described as a thrusting sword, but is in fact nicely balanced for cutting. Archaeological evidence from
                                    Maiden Castle hill fort, captured by Legio II Augusta in 43 A.D., confirms its use in this way, though
                                    possibly only by back-rankers to make sure of enemy on the ground as the assault pressed on over them. The
                                    Gladius was balanced on the other side by a dagger, the Pugio.
                              </p>
                              <p class="card-text text-justify">Although the legs are almost always depicted as bare, one carving of a Roman warship of around this period
                                    shows apparent Legionarii mingling with its marines and wearing identical breeches. It is possible that this
                                    concession to comfort was also allowed in other harsh living conditions.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">This man differs from the previous one in having a later type of bronze helmet with larger neck and cheek
                                    guards and with a reinforcing flange added to protect the weak place over the forehead. Helmet crest and
                                    woollen tunic were now probably finally standardised on red for the new long service professional army.
                                    His shield is a lighter and handier pattern squared off at the top and bottom. Some of these have central spines
                                    like that illustrated previously, and may be cut down conversions.
                                    </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The point should be made that the introduction of a new pattern of equipment did not mean that the old types
                                    were necessarily withdrawn. This may have been the case with praetorians, but archaeological evidence
                                    suggests that older models were either reworked to approximate the new type or simply kept in use until they
                                    wore out. This could lead to a considerable mixture within a single unit.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">This man wears an iron helmet of Imperial-Gallic type, coming much lower over the neck. It has a raised
                                    guard above the ear aperture, and is embossed with an eyebrow design on the forehead, ridges near the junction with the neck guard 
                                    and small bosses on the cheek pieces. He wears a scarf inside the neck of his
                                    armour. Under the armour and over his tunic he wears a soft leather or textile garment with double rows of
                                    dangling heavy leather strips called Pteruges at shoulders and waist. These proieCt below the mail to provide
                                    extra protection for the upper arms and thighs. A reconstruction based on the damaged funeral monument of
                                    Caius Valerius Crispus from Wiesbaden has unfortunately interpreted the lower set of Pteruges as a very
                                    peculiar pair of patterned shorts, and has been widely copied. Further protection is provided by the
                                    Cingulum, a metal plated belt incorporating narrower but metal studded danglers over the genitals.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The shield shown is the parallel sided semi-cylindrical version which today is popularly thought of as the
                                    typical Roman shield and referred to as a Scutum. In actual fact, Scutum was the general Roman term for all
                                    large shields including the various oval and modified oval types, and the semi-cylindrical shield was a minor
                                    variant on that to be shown next. Both the new types were much more curved than previous types. They were
                                    held in the same way by a single grip behind the boss at ninety degrees to the long axes of the shield, and so
                                    could be punched offensively at an opponent.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The Gladius now hangs from a baldric over the shoulder instead of from the belt. The Pugio remains where
                                    it was.</p>

                            <h6 class="card-title text-right">LEGIONARIUS OF THE MID lST TO EARLY 2ND CENTURIES A.D</h6>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The mail corslet or Lorica Hamata has been replaced by the Lorica Segmentata, a laminated defence of iron
                                    plates linked ﬂexibly together by leather thongs and brass hinges. Early models seem to have had their
                                    teething troubles as broken ﬁttings are common on archaeological sites, but an improved version remedied the
                                    weaknesses. The Lorica Segmentata became the standard body armour for the men of western, if not all
                                    Legiones, but it is not completely certain whether it was ever used by Legiones stationed near the eastern
                                    frontier, and the reasons for its introduction are not really known. It supplied greater protection for the vital
                                    areas at the expense of removing it from some non-vital areas, and should therefore presumably reﬂect the use
                                    by opponents of weapons capable of penetrating mail to an unwelcome extent. If it was not used in the east, as
                                    was suggested to the author by the late H. Russell Robinson, this could be due to the better ventilation of
                                    mail, or possibly to the main threat there being from the light arrows of horse archers rather than from the
                                    heavier ﬂung spears of western barbarians. The changeover seems to have taken place rather quickly, and it is
                                    possible that the mail corslets were withdrawn and reissued to auxiliary infantry previously unarmoured.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The horse tail helmet crest was now replaced by a clip-on rectangular box crest holding either relatively short
                                    horse hair bristles, as in the case of the ordinary Legionarius, or possibly feathers in the case of higher ranks.
                                    The battle scenes on Traian’s Column demonstrate that rank-and-ftle did not at that time wear helmet crests in
                                    battle.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The shield differs from that of the last figure mainly in having curved rather than parallel sides. A few seem to
                                    have central ribs, and many others have thunderbolt decorations giving the impression of such a rib. The
                                    curved side shield is closer in design to earlier shields than the straight sided version, so can be presumed to be
                                    earlier. It continued in use alongside the straight shield and eventually inspired its successor.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The Pilum has been made still heavier by the addition of a large lead weight at the point of balance. The
                                    Gladius has acquired a sharper point, presumably as thrusting became increasingly more favoured than
                                    cutting. While it continues to hang on what we today consider the more awkward right side on formal
                                    monuments such as Traian’s Column, less formal monuments sometimes show it on the left, possibly
                                    reﬂecting a difference between official policy and individual practice..</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Praetorian units identified on Traian‘s Column by their shield decorations are dressed and equipped identi-
                                    cally to Legionarii. It seems likely that they would have been the first to get new equipment and would have
                                    been more consistenly equipped than the Legiones.</p>

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">This man has a developed version of the Lorica Segmentata with simpler and stronger fastenings, worn over
                                an undergarment with leather Pteruges. Auxiliary pattern breeches had been increasingly used on a semi-
                                oﬂicial basis in inclement conditions over the previous hundred years, and now became standard at all times.
                                They are often stated to have been of leather, but I know of no direct evidence for this, and wool seems more

                            <h6 class="card-title">LEGIONARIUS OF THE MID 3RD TO 5TH CENTURIES A.D.</h6>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The great increase in the size of the army from Septimius Severus time onwards, plus the increased demand
                                for cavalry armour, meant that a cheaper method of armouring infantry had to be found. The solution
                                apparently adopted was to use a moulded muscle cuirasse of rawhide with attached Pteruges. Rawhide is both
                                strong and light, and any reduction in protection was made up by the larger shield also introduced. However,
                                it provides a rigid defence rather than the ﬂexible one of earlier armour types, which may be why the Gladius
                                was replaced by the longer Spatha, maintaining the same weapon reach. Alternative explanations of the
                                copious monumental evidence, that the armour is of iron mail over an undergarment or of iron or bronze
                                plate, do not hold up. Firstly, muscle shapes and navel are depicted, ruling out mail. Secondly, plate corslets
                                would have provided no more protection than Lorica Segmentata, been far less convenient to wear, and been
                                far more difficult and expensive to produce. Colour depictions show the corslet the same yellow-brown as the
                                Peteruges.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Depictions on monuments from far apart places are so identical that I hesitate to ascribe this type to artistic
                                ignorance. A more likely explanation is that the elite Comitatenses and Palatina units likely to be depicted on
                                monuments had in fact a more expensive type than border Legiones. It is noteworthy that while most helmets
                                on monuments are shown crested, the helmets found have no obvious attachment for a crest.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The crest type depicted is accompanied by others up to the mid-4th century A.D., then becomes universal.
                                The other early types include the horse tail type of No.'s l to 3 as well as the succeeding box crest.
                                </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The oval shield is not only much larger than the previous model, but almost ﬂat instead of laterally curved,
                                made of solid planks instead of plywood, and supported by a double grip at elbow and hand instead of at the
                                centre only. This is plainly shown by a number of monuments.
                                </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Weapons have also changed. The Pilum has now been replaced by the Spiculum, a rather lighter spear but
                                retaining much of the former weapon’s armour piercing characteristics while being more suitable for holding off cavalry when retained 
                                in the hand. It is combined with a lighter and longer ranged iavelin called the Verutum. This had a narrow armour-piercing head 
                                similar to that of the larger weapon, though obviously with nothing like the same chance of penetrating.
                                </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">These “common missile weapons” as Vegetius calls them, were increasingly supplemented during the course
                                of the 5th century AD. by the Martiobarbulus. This was a small lead weighted throwing dart stabilised by a
                                feathered tail, ﬁve of which were carried in the hollow of the shield. They had little armour penetrating
                                power, but their barbed heads made them very suitable for crippling an unarmoured man or animal, while
                                they greatly outranged conventional iavelins. Initially introduced in Diocletian’s newly created Legiones
                                Palatinae, the Joviani and Herculiani, they rapidly spread, first probably to the Mattiari, then to other
                                Legiones, and ﬁnally to Auxilia. Possibly because of the new emphasis on long range lighting, the Spiculum
                                seems to have gone out of use at the end of the 4th century A.D., but the Verutum remained in use until the
                                end.
                                </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">The long bladed Spatha that replaced the Gladius is often described as a barbarian cutting weapon. This is not
                                so. It is best described as a dual purpose weapon optimised for thrusting, and does not derive from Celtic
                                cutting weapons, though it was to develop into the Dark Age and Medieval swords.
