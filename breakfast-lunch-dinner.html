                            <h4 class="card-title">Roman meals</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">There were three meals in ancient Rome we had Ientaculum which was 
                                breakfast. Prandium which would be modern days lunch although it was differently and I will explain 
                                this in a minute and then Coena which would be dinner let's examine all these in details. 
                              </p>
                              <p class="card-text text-justify">Ientaculum the first thing we have to say about Ientaculum is that it began 
                                    with a glass of water so this is something the Romans used to do. As they 
                                    would drink this glass of water they would begin eating that what was their 
                                    Ientaculum made of what we have quite a lot of possibilities so let's examine 
                                    all of these. First of all, one very common possibility in the times of Rome 
                                    was to eat the leftovers of dinner in which case we would have bread, cheese, 
                                    olives and honey. Another kind of breakfast was to dunk bread into 
                                    sweetened wine so this was another way to have breakfast. And thirdly was to eat bread 
                                    with oil vinegar and salt. Another typical kind of breakfast was bread and figs. Now children ate differently 
                                    normally they were just a breakfast or Ientaculum with bread and milk.                                       
                              </p>
                        </div>

            <div class="card col-md-12 p-3 spacer200top" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="3000">
                <div class="row ">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <div class="card-block">
                            <h4 class="card-title text-left">Prandium</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Prandium, first because we need to say couple of things about the word Prandium is where the modern Italian word pranzo comes from. Although in modern Italian pranzo is different in a way because pranzo in Italy or lunch is the main meal. But for the Romans Prandium is basically a second breakfast so to speak. It was eaten at midday it was frugal and it was normally eaten 
                                    standing because you have to consider that at that time most people were 
                                    working in the city that were not back home so often they would simply buy 
                                    something off from vendors and and consume the frugal lunch or Prandium 
                                    just before going back to work. During winter they would eat hot food and during 
                                    summer the would eat fresh food. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">A typical Prandium consisted of bread cold meat, fish, legumes, eggs, fruit and 
                                    wine. Sometimes instead of just simply drinking wine they would drink Mulsum 
                                    which was a drink made of wine mixed with honey. So the main meal for the 
                                    Romans was the Coena now this meal here would normally start around 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon and it could go on until the next morning depending of course on the social status of the people we are talking about. In early Roman time, talking about Republican times they would they would eat just a soup of legumes, milk, cheese, fresh fruit, and dry fruit as well and lard.
                                    To consider, lard was an important component of Roman diet and as 
                                    much a fat. Lard was also eaten by legionaries quite a lot but with the 
                                    late Republic and imperial times bread and meat start to become more common even in the lower classes.                                                                         
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">If they had guests they would have them over for dinner and the meal was not 
                                    called Coena anymore it was called Convivium having Gustum or starters 
                                    Caput Cenae which were the main courses Mensa Secunda which was the 
                                    dessert.                                     
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Triclinium</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">In the case of patricians or Roman nobility these meals would be directed 
                                by the chef and all the guests would be wearing the Vestis Cenatoria which were 
                                lavish clothing worn after the hot baths.                                     
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">So as was said before, in ancient Rome most meals would be eaten 
                                standing. But as time passes we have the invention of the Triclinium which was an either 
                                oval shaped or rectangular table and around this triclinium we have the Lecti which were 
                                basically those beds where Romans would lay down and eat typical of iconography.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Now when you see an image of triclinium and leg Lecti with also women then we are talking about Imperial times because it was an imperial times that women would lay down as well and you would have these very long Cenae with music and dances and singing. initially the Cenae would be consumed in the atrium 
                                so we're talking about kind of a lobby outside the house but as houses becomes 
                                bigger we start seeing the development and building of several dining halls. The 
                                typical number of commensals was nine and multiple of nine until thirty-six 
                                young children will be sitting on stools rather than actual beds where as 
                                slaves will be sitting on the Floor.
                            </p>
